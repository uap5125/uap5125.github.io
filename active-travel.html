            <p>As research and technology continue to develop, Urban and Regional planners must focus more
than ever on how to be ready and design for the future. Since transportation connects the world
together, planners have to be one step ahead of technology in order to understand the social and
economic impacts of new technology, like autonomous vehicles (AVs), on society. Moreover, not
only do planners need to understand these technologies and how they will impact different cities and
towns, but also how AVs will impact the broader connectivity of cities to cities and how transit
infrastructure will need to be redesigned and implemented in the safest, equitable, and
environmentally sustainable way possible. Planners must prepare citizens for the economic and
social changes that AVs will have on the ability to move from one destination to the other and how
cities will be rebuilt on and because of these implications..</p>

            <p>Some cities, like Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California to
name a few, already have reliable public transit and alternative transit infrastructure built into their
design, however many places do not. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (PBIC) paper,
Discussion on Automated and Connected Vehicles, Pedestrians, and Bicyclists (2018), recognizes
that the technological advances that have not been properly planned for may produce tumultuous
conditions for biking and walking which would affect quality of life anywhere that human street
activity is essential (p. 4). This paper also suggests 10 key problems that planners should consider
when working with members of the public to plan for major infrastructural changes and ensure that
peoples’ quality of life does not decrease (p. 4).</p>

            <p>These 10 problems related to cyclists and pedestrians that PBIC says need to be at the
center of AV conversations are the following: 1. the detection problem. 2. the V2X problems
(vehicle to pedestrian) 3. the communication problem. 4. the right of way problem. 5. the passing
problem. 6. the speed problem. 7. the pickup/dropoff problem 8. the driver handoff problem. 9. the
mode shift problem. 10. the data problem (2018).</p>

            <p>Similarly, in the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals (ABPB) “Policy Statement: Automated Vehicles,” (2018), it is made aware that ABPB holds the position that AVs carry potential for both positive and negative outcomes, but the design and operation ensures functional safety for all people using the highways and streets. Their greatest concern involves AVs ability to detect and protect those walking and bicycling--regardless of age, ability, location, time of day, and other factors (2018). ABPB’s main goal is to support the community of professionals who work to create more walkable, bikeable places where street designs are accessible and safe for everyone and everywhere (2018). </p>

            <p>By the same token, Paul Lewis, et al (2017) note that growing interest, testing, and investment in AVs will shift transportation and mobility options for many people. "Private sector initiatives and university research have led the way in AV development, mostly through a mixture of public and private funding. These range from private tech companies like Google and Uber; to automakers like Tesla, Audi, GM, and Ford; to universities like Carnegie Mellon and the University of Michigan. As of August 2016, there were at least 30 companies developing AVs" (p. 23). </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading"></h2>

            <p>In “Shifting Autonomous Vehicles Future Scenarios” (2018), research introduces a possible future scenario for robotics technology called "urban ushers" that could play a role in pedestrian safety as crossing guard for example. </p>

            <p>Furthermore, ‘urban ushers’ could direct AV traffic and translate instructions into signage for deaf pedestrians. A specific example is the Hitachi’s experimental “patrol robot,” a trash can-sized robotic concept AV. </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Some of its features include "pedestrian safety in the public realm by greeting school children and seniors by name, summoning paramedics during emergencies, and providing auxiliary street lighting—all 24/7, over and over, without overtime pay. Future ushers might also allocate curb access in real time using dynamic pricing."</blockquote>

            <p>This research also noted the need for door-to-door mobility which has been spearheaded by the rise of urban cycling, bike share, and bike share programs. AVs could certainly be an addition to this mobility, but does that mean existing bike and pedestrian infrastructure and accessibility will be non-existent in the future? </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Pedaling for the future</h2>

            <p>Research from PBIC (2018) notes that "pedestrians and bicyclists are a powerful indicator of the social and economic health and safety of a community. A high level of pedestrian and bicycle activity in a community is often associated with more robust economies and healthier, more socially-cohesive populations, while a lack of pedestrian and bicycle activity on roadways can be an indicator that personal security and safety needs are not being met or that destinations cannot be accessed on foot or by bike” (p. 2) This report offers 10 challenge areas that must be at the center of AV discussions across all stakeholders and sectors along with a glossary of terms. The purpose is to use the report as a discussion guide for people who want to enter the conversation about AVs and driverless technology. For instance, if AVs are shared, there could be an increase in their overall public transit use and non-motorized transit, including: “bus, rail, walking, bicycling and carpooling” (Automated vehicles, on-demand mobility, and environmental impacts 2015).

            <p>Seattle also recognizes ride sharing in their New Mobility Playbook (2017), details the expansion of “transportation options so people can safely and easily take transit, walk, and bike, rather than driving for most trips” (p. 15). In order to reduce the necessity of owning a car, Seattle promotes “services like car sharing and ride-hailing” in order to provide “flexibility” (New mobility playbook, p. 16). In this way, “people can rely on walking, biking, and transit but still have access to a car where and when they need one” (New mobility playbook, p. 16). The New Mobility Playbook also showcases a plan called “Vision Zero” which aspires to “end traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030”; because of this and the “Safe Routes to School programs,” “Seattle is now one of the safest big cities in America for people walking and riding bikes” (pg. 15).</p>

            <p>However, there are also areas of danger, like the AVs being tested in San Francisco that displayed “many of the most dangerous driver behaviours – running through red lights, making unsafe right turns in front of bike lanes, and failing to yield to pedestrians” (New mobility, autonomous vehicles and the region, 2017). Therefore, it is imperative for this research to understand all the social and economic implications so planners can better provide safer and accessible infrastructure as AVs continue to gain traction.</p>
