            <p>As research and technology continue to develop, Urban and Regional planners must focus more
than ever on how to be ready and design for the future. Since transportation connects the world
together, planners have to be one step ahead of technology in order to understand the social and
economic impacts of new technology, like autonomous vehicles (AVs), on society. Moreover, not
only do planners need to understand these technologies and how they will impact different cities and
towns, but also how AVs will impact the broader connectivity of cities to cities and how transit
infrastructure will need to be redesigned and implemented in the safest, equitable, and
environmentally sustainable way possible. Planners must prepare citizens for the economic and
social changes that AVs will have on the ability to move from one destination to the other and how
cities will be rebuilt on and because of these implications..</p>

            <p>Some cities, like Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California to
name a few, already have reliable public transit and alternative transit infrastructure built into their
design, however many places do not. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (PBIC) paper,
Discussion on Automated and Connected Vehicles, Pedestrians, and Bicyclists (2018), recognizes
that the technological advances that have not been properly planned for may produce tumultuous
conditions for biking and walking which would affect quality of life anywhere that human street
activity is essential (p. 4). This paper also suggests 10 key problems that planners should consider
when working with members of the public to plan for major infrastructural changes and ensure that
peoples’ quality of life does not decrease (p. 4).</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Pedaling for the future</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
